## üöó What This Mod Does

S1FuelMod adds realistic fuel consumption to all land vehicles in Schedule I. Vehicles now require fuel to operate, with consumption rates tied to throttle input and vehicle speed. When fuel runs low, engines sputter and eventually shut down, forcing players to manage their fuel economy and visit gas stations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Realistic Fuel Consumption**: Vehicles consume fuel based on throttle and speed (6L/min full throttle, 0.5L/min idle)
- **Per-Vehicle Fuel Tanks**: Different capacities for each vehicle type (Shitbox: 30L, Dinkler: 55L, etc.)
- **Interactive Gas Stations**: Refuel at the two gas stations in the game world
- **Dynamic Fuel Pricing**: Prices vary by day and scale with player tier level
- **Real-time Fuel Gauge**: HUD display with color-coded warnings for low fuel
- **Engine Performance**: Stuttering and shutdown mechanics when fuel is depleted
- **Multiplayer Sync**: Fuel states synchronize across multiplayer sessions
- **Persistent Fuel Levels**: Fuel amounts save and load with your game

## üéÆ Gameplay Impact

- **Strategic Planning**: Plan routes and manage fuel economy
- **Economic Depth**: Fuel costs add another money management layer
- **Risk Management**: Running out of fuel can leave you stranded
- **Multiplayer Coordination**: Team up to share fuel resources
